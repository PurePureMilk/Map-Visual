    <h1><b> Groundwater Models </b></h1>
    <p>
      The models below map out the wetness percentile of three different layers:
      surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, and groundwater. The
      surface soil moisture contains soil particles. You take a cubic volume.
      There are some level spaces that are filled what water. Some of them are
      filled with soil particles. Some of them are just empty spaces. The
      surface soil moisture is near the land surface, and for this data, it
      would be the top centimeters of the land surface. The root zone soil
      moisture is one matter from the land surface. Two meters below there's
      groundwater. This represents shallow groundwater. How shallow groundwater
      fluctuates is by varying with precipitation. If there's a lot of
      precipitation, the groundwater table may rise. During the summer, when
      there's no precipitation, a lot of the evaporated groundwater may drop or
      decrease. We use the percentiles to indicate a drier condition or wetter
      condition. The lower percentile represents dry conditions and the high
      percentile represents wet conditions.
